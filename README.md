# scoreboard
Scoreboards for MLB, Mexican Baseball league and Latin American Winter Leagues.
The intention is to provide a way to learn Java FX and the integration with Android and iOS.
The use of the compiled software is free and you MUST NOT USE IT FOR ANY COMMERCIAL USE and you accept that you are accessing MLB files  for your personal and no commercial use.
The software is just a translator from the MLB files used and the user, so the use that the user does with that information is outside of the programmers reach.
